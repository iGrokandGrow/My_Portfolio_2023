> Data is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and art, and it lies between the pit of man's fears, and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call, The Grokker Zone.[^1]

> Planned Projects:
>  1. Regression Analysis: Williams Sisters: Serena who won more Grand Slam titles than any person during the Open era of tennis and her sister Venus who earned seven Grand Slam titles, five Wimbledon championships and four Olympic gold medals vs male opponents . Serena and Venus have both stated during interviews that they could not win a match against a male opponent. The questions I want to answer: Is it true they can't win? What would it take for either or both of the Williams sisters to win a match against a male opponent and would the probability of their win be affected by the age of the sisters at the time of the match?
> 2. Factor Analysis: Florence Griffith-Joyner is still considered by many to be the fastest woman of all time. Recently, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Sha'Carri Richardson had personal bests in the 100m  in 2022 and 2023 which made them world champions. Yet they have not beaten FloJo's records in the 100m. The questions I want to answer: What factors contributed the most to FLoJo's success? If given the same training technology as current runners how much faster would FloJo run the 100m? If Shelly and Sha'Carri trained like Flo Jo would the training allow them to match or surpass FloJo's records?
> 3. Cohort Analysis: The questions I want to answer: Who are the collectors of art produced by black artists? The collectors will be divided by race, subdivided by the race of the artist and locale. Which art do they tend to purchase most often based on the types of images of black Americans (positive, negative, and the skin tone of the subject as well as the artist). 
> 4. Monte Carlo Simulation: Analyze the effectiveness of traffic management strategies during emergency evacuations. I will simulate various scenarios, such as different evacuation routes, traffic flow adjustments, and population distributions, to determine the most efficient strategy for minimizing congestion and evacuation time.
> 5. Time Series Analysis: In this project I will focus on predicting cash flow patterns for ATM machines in a banking network. I will use historical data on transaction volumes, weekdays, holidays, and economic indicators to build a predictive model. The questions I will answer: What is the financial trends and provide insights to optimize cash management strategies for the bank.
> 6. SQL, Excel, Python - create an app to scour job postings, returm data to sql db, export keywords of job desc I apply to, narrow the list more to highlight words in job desc where I receive an interview. job openings fitting keywords will kick off a script to update cover letter and resume then notify me when it is time to apply for the job. i will review the letter and resume then kick off a script to apply
