> Data is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and art, and it lies between the pit of man's fears, and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call, The Grokker Zone.[^1]

> Planned Projects:
>  1. Regression Analysis: Williams Sisters: Serena who won more Grand Slam titles than any person during the Open era of tennis and her sister Venus who earned seven Grand Slam titles, five Wimbledon championships and four Olympic gold medals vs male opponents . Serena and Venus have both stated during interviews that they could not win a match against a male opponent. The questions I want to answer: Is it true they can't win? What would it take for either or both of the Williams sisters to win a match against a male opponent and would the probability of their win be affected by the age of the sisters at the time of the match?
> 2. Factor Analysis: Florence Griffith-Joyner is still considered by many to be the fastest woman of all time. Recently, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Sha'Carri Richardson had personal bests in the 100m  in 2022 and 2023 which made them world champions. Yet they have not beaten FloJo's records in the 100m. The questions I want to answer: What factors contributed the most to FLoJo's success? If given the same training technology as current runners how much faster would FloJo run the 100m? If Shelly and Sha'Carri trained like Flo Jo would the training allow them to match or surpass FloJo's records?
> 3. Cohort Analysis: The questions I want to answer: Who are the collectors of art produced by black artists? The collectors will be divided by race, subdivided by the race of the artist and locale. Which art do they tend to purchase most often based on the types of images of black Americans (positive, negative, and the skin tone of the subject as well as the artist).
